Project Title: Mining Warcraft

Description:  Finding trends in Warcraft for popularity over time, by demographics, and YouTube presence, and examine the in-game economy

Data: Blizzard API (https://dev.battle.net)for statistics: profile and game data available; RealmPop for geographic/regional breakdowns
(appears to be data from battle.net, too)

3-5 initial research questions:
1.	First, what are the basic user stats…can we track all user data by gender and age over time?
2.	Can we track how long the average user ‘sticks around’? Frequency and duration of ‘breaks’ from playing
3.	What kind of player to player buy/sell/trade actions happen? Examine trends within the ‘in-game economy’
4.	Is it possible to track popularity with YouTube video views? Start with number of channels, expand into number of video views?

Techniques and Tools: slack channel and git repository established

Data Shortcomings: not available yet

Update 8/7/2018

Where to get Data: get stock values over time from stock exchange trackers? Create dataframe for release date info from Ellen's research

Having difficulties finding demographic stats over time from Blizzard API, need to rexamine where data comes from.

New research questions:
  1. Is there a correlation between stock values of Blizzard and Expansion version releases for WOW? 
    Null Hypothesis: There is no correlation between Blizzard Stock value and expansion version release dates  
  2. Is there a correlation between YouTube video views for Blizzard channel (shows popularity?) and version releases?

NEW Description of project is to find indicators of popularity since tracking demographic data over time is proving problematic, as in blizzard api does not appear to give data other than CURRENT user demographic data
