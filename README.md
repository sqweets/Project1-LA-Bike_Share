Project Title: Mining Warcraft

Description:  Finding trends in Warcraft for popularity over time, by demographics, and YouTube presence, and examine the in-game economy

Data: Blizzard API (https://dev.battle.net)for statistics: profile and game data available; RealmPop for geographic/regional breakdowns
(appears to be data from battle.net, too)

3-5 initial research questions:
1.	First, what are the basic user stats…can we track all user data by gender and age over time?
2.	Can we track how long the average user ‘sticks around’? Frequency and duration of ‘breaks’ from playing
3.	What kind of player to player buy/sell/trade actions happen? Examine trends within the ‘in-game economy’
4.	Is it possible to track popularity with YouTube video views? Start with number of channels, expand into number of video views?

Techniques and Tools: slack channel and git repository established

Data Shortcomings: not available yet
